# 🚀 CraftNet

**CraftNet** is a deep learning-based image classification app built with **PyTorch**, using a fine-tuned **ResNet-18** model. It identifies vehicles across three modes of transport — **airplanes**, **cars**, and **ships** — through a clean and interactive **Streamlit** web interface.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧠 Built on top of **ResNet-18**
- 🖥️ Streamlit-powered Web UI
- 🔁 Easily extendable for other categories
- 🗃️ Simple directory-based dataset structure
- 💾 Trained weights export for reuse

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 🏃 Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Make sure `vehicle_classification_model.pth` and `class_names.txt` are in the same directory.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Train Your Own Classifier

### 1. 🗂️ Organize Your Dataset

Structure your dataset like this:

```
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── class_1/
│   ├── class_2/
│   └── ...
└── test/
    ├── class_1/
    ├── class_2/
    └── ...
```

Each subfolder must contain images of that class.

### 2. ⚙️ Modify Training Script

In `train.py`, set the `data_dir` path:

```python
data_dir = 'dataset'  # update this if using a different folder
```

The number of classes is automatically determined from the subfolder names.

### 3. 🧠 Run Training

```bash
python train.py
```

This will:

* Fine-tune ResNet-18 on your dataset
* Save the model as `vehicle_classification_model.pth`
* Save class labels to `class_names.txt`

### 4. 🚀 Run App with New Model

Once training is done, simply run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Make sure `vehicle_classification_model.pth` and `class_names.txt` are updated with your new model and class list.

## 📌 Notes

* Model uses **transfer learning** — only the final layer is trained.
* Normalization is done using ImageNet mean & std for compatibility with pretrained ResNet.
* GPU will be used automatically if available.
